# Overlook Hotel

Overlook Hotel is the seven day final project for Front End Engineering students in Module 2 at the Turing School of Software & Design. Students work individually to create a hotel management application with mock customer, room, booking and room service datasets. The project spec asks students to manipulate and display the data typical for hotel front desk tasks: arriving guests, new guests, existing room bookings, existing room service orders, data for individual customer histories, and adding new room service orders and room bookings to a particular customer.

This project was built from a small starter kit using JavaScript, HTML/SCSS, Chart.js, Illustrator, ESlint and Mocha/Chai. This project is also the first at Turing to use multiple fetch calls for separate datasets. Students were challenged to incorporate many lessons learned during Module 2, including the principles of Object Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development.
